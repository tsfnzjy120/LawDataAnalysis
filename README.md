Analysis of Law Data
## Notes
- This project is about supporting data and program for some published papers. 
- Actually it is not a perfect program, and I would update it occasionally. In the process of improvement, some codes or documents might be inconsistent which doesn't affect normal usage. **Recent Status: Improving**
- To run this program, you need:
    - [x] Configure MariaDB Server, Insert Data in *.sql file and Adjust MariaDB Variables in settings.py
    - [x] Install python-package: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - [x] Might alter some absolute file paths
